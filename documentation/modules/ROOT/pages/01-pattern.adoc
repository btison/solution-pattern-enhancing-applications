== The story behind this solution pattern

Globex is a fictitious retail company. The company recently started a digital transformation and cloud adoption journey. As part of this initiative, the development and devops teams have completed the modernization of the existing multi-tier monolithic retail e-commerce web application. The monolithic application was split in a couple of loosely-coupled microservices and the application was rehosted on OpenShift.

The devops team also adopted GitOps practices for rapid and continuous deployment.

The outcome of this application modernization effort is an increased velocity of application development and deployment, and an overall faster go to market for new functionalities.

A schematic overview of the current state of the application after the first phase of the application modernization effort:

* The application is split into microservices and runs on OpenShift. As such it inherits all the benefits of the de-facto enterprise Kubernetes distribution: horizontal scaling, automated rollout/rollback, bin-packing, self healing, service discovery, load balancing, etc.

* Adoption of GitOps practices decreases Lead Time for Change, Mean Time to Recover and Change Failure Rate while increasing Deployment Frequency

Taking advantage of this new momentum, the business comes up with new requirements for the e-commerce application:

* Multi-channel approach: includes a mobile application in addition to the retail web-site. Globex does not have the necessary expertise in mobile development, so development will have to be outsourced.
* The ability to track user activity on the website and the mobile application.
* Highlight products which generate most customer interest as featured products.
* Provide a personalized experience for users on the website and mobile application.
